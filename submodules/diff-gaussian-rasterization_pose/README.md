## Differential Gaussian Rasterization for DG-SLAM

This is a modified Differential 3DGS(3D Gaussian Splatting) Rasterization version based on [orgin 3DGS Rasterization implementation](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/diff-gaussian-rasterization/tree/59f5f77e3ddbac3ed9db93ec2cfe99ed6c5d121d).

We add some addition support for the DG-SLAM:

- Depth forward rendering 
- Depth rendering backward
- Pose optimization backward

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Please follow the instructions below to install the dependencies.
```bash
python setup.py install
pip install .
```

**NOTE**: The  input parameters and rasterization operations have diverged significantly from the original 3DGS codebase to align with specific requirements and match the desigend structure of DG-SLAM.
